One way is using the combo box next to the "Save as..." label, it will automatically adds the format after you click the "Save" button to choose the file path. For example, if you choose a .jpg in combox and click the "Save" button, and then key in the file name "ABC" in the propmted dialog and click save, our program will save your image as ABC.jpg.
The other way to save is click the save button and directly key in the whole image name with desinated format, such as "ABC.png". Our program will take this as image format, even if the combo box is choosing other formats, such as .jpg, .png or .ppm.
